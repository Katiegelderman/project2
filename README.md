### Description of dataset:

### Question 1:
Question: Is there a monthly trend in the Sale Amounts of real estate listings in Connecticut?

Importance:

We seek to find if there are specific months of the year when the properties listed for sale in any given month have had on average higher or lower Sale Amounts compared to other months. We believe that in our pursuit to answer this question, the data we find could offer insight into when the real estate market in Connecticut is most and least affordable, and if there is a seasonality within this market.

It could also correlate to how seasonality affects the housing market in other states besides Connecticut. More analysis incorporating datasets from other states would need to be conducted to determine if patterns similar to Connecticutâ€™s are present, but this data could provide us with the foundation needed to understand a broader range of markets.

We believe that our analysis could provide important information regarding real estate market habits and strategies in Connecticut; however, we acknowledge that there are many factors outside of our dataset that could play a role in manipulating our data, and that seasonality is likely not a standalone factor.
